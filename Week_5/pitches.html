<h3>1: The Drug Shortage Shortage</h3>
<p>
On Halloween of 2013, the FDA released another <a href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm373044.htm">strategic plan</a> to combat drug shortages. Will it work? You have no way to find out - you can't go check drug shortage trends for yourself, beyond today's current shortages listed on the FDA site. Unless you're a data journalist, that probably doesn't scare you - but it should. Without a publically accessible database, interpreting the shortages and evaluating the effects of actions to prevent them is a free-for-all with lives at stake: Aside from the FDA, who presumably has all the data filed somewhere (and possibly <a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/590/586999.pdf">University of Utah</a>) people are left guessing at how effective countermeasures are, what broader trends are at play, and what drugs are likely to go.
</p>
<p>
Last semester, I partially compiled that database by scraping data off of <a href="http://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a>, which had records of the FDA's <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugShortages/ucm050792.htm">drug shortage site</a> going back to 2009. The problem was, the HTML files were incredibly disorganized and it was really difficult to get correct data - I took an extremely long time hand-verifying the data and correcting strange errors introduced by the fact that the site didn't standardize how they entered their data. Although I knew the next step was to get additional data from the site about the causes of each of the shortages and the companies that were short, I realized that I had neither the database knowledge nor the scraping skills to make my dataset as useful as possible. So I conceded defeat for the moment.
</p>
<p>
But now is the time! With the explicit instruction to learn something new, I will re-tackle this project to get useful data on drug shortages - at which point I will be able to check the effectiveness of the FDA's shortage-alleviating tactics and search for trends (for instance, one of my professors has a theory that some companies are switching off who has a shortage, driving up demand for the drug to their mutual benefit). I will have to learn how to make a database in something other than Excel (because my data is too multi-dimensional: each data point is a drug, a date, and several attributes like the company with the shortage and the shortage's reasons), and I will have to learn how to be a data-gathering and cleaning wizard to get around the sketchy HTML and actually scrape all of that information for about 300 different dates and 270 drugs. Once I do that, I will need to develop a way of displaying the information that, if not actually presenting it in an easy-to-understand way, at least lets me find the trends and spikes in shortage that I need to understand what's going on.
</p>
<p>
A story like this would work well somewhere like ProPublica, and I'd also like to make the database publicly available so people can answer their own questions about drug shortages. My previous professor, Charles Seife, would be a good source for explaining the usefulness of this data - and could likely suggest others to comment on what it uncovers.

<h3>2: Are science journalists only talking to themselves?</h3>
<p>
When I started at NYU's Science, Health and Environmental Reporting Program, our program director forced us all to get Twitter accounts. So we did, and we retweeted each other's work and followed all of the big science journalists. But the reason I didn't have a Twitter account was because of a sneaking suspicion I developed working on the social media for Boston Children's Hospital over the summer: Science journalists on Twitter are <i>way</i> more into Twitter than their desired audience.
</p>
<p>
So are science journalists only talking to themselves? In order to find out, I will learn how to download tweets and other information from Twitter, and I will try to map out who's favoriting, retweeting, or responding to science journalists' tweets - and create a diagram of the network to reveal whether their reach is as far as they'd hope. In order to do this I'll have to probably pick a list of several prominent science writers (often highlighted on public lists like <a href="https://twitter.com/scottdodd/science-journalists">this</a> to focus on, which I could expand if everything went smoothly. I'd have to find a way to categorize accounts as "science writers/media outlets" vs "target audience," and I'd have to learn how to use a network-drawing interface - I feel like those exist online as long as you don't require too much customization.
</p>
<p>
This kind of article could fit well in a number of outlets, particularly tech or journalism-oriented ones. Combining it with quotes from journalists or PR people about how they use Twitter or whether they think it's useful could add interest beyond just looking at the network and reading conclusions about it. I'd start by reaching out to Adam Glenn, a journalist and professor at CUNY who specializes in social media and how it's used journalistically.

Note that I okayed the first pitch with Kevin ahead of time, because it was based on an earlier project, and he asked that I pitch at least one other topic. Thus only having two.
