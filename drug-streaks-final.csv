The 350 mg vials are on back order with estimated release in the 4th quarter of 2010.--Reminder: There is potential for dosing errors when interchanging leucovorin and levoleucovorin (Fusilev). The dose of levoleucovorin (Fusilev) is one-half the dose of racemic leucovorin injection (e.g., levoleucovorin [Fusilev] 7.5 mg = racemic leucovorin 15 mg).--For more information visit: Spectrum Pharmaceuticals web site.~~~"
